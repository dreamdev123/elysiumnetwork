				<p style="text-align: justify;">Acting responsibly is central to Elysium’s aim of providing participants with strong and sustainable long-term trading bot returns, via our signals based on quantitative analysis. Participating in financial markets for instance can be one of the key ways to generate wealth, but it’s easy to overdo it. The decisions you make should depend upon your cash flow and budget. Financial experts agree that starting your retirement savings early is important, as it is committing only as much as you can responsibly afford.</p>

				<h3 style="min-height: 55px;">THE RIGHT BOT STRATEGIES AT YOUR PREFERRED, 3RD PARTY BROKERAGES.</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Your trading bot strategy trades are connected and executed at your own discretion via your preferred 3rd party authorised prime brokerages and tier-1 liquidity providers registered with the Financial Supervisory Authority, in full transparency and with segregated accounts. They are committed to the utmost asset protection of their participants and to participants enjoying a strong sense of security, knowing their funds are deposited in segregated accounts. We would never refer you to an unregulated broker.</p>
