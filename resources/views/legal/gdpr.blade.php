      <P>1. Security and Protection of your Personal Information</P>
      <P>We consider it our priority to protect the conﬁdentiality of the personal information that you have shared with us and to protect it from any unauthorised access. Consequently, we employ state-of-the-art security standards in order to ensure maximum protection of your personal information.<br /><br />

        <p>2. Access Data</p>

If you wish to view our website, we will collect the following data that is technically necessary for us to display our website to you and to guarantee stability and security:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>• Your IP address </li>
            <li>• The date and time of the enquiry</li>

        <p>However, our web server stores this data separately from other data in the form of W3C web logs with an extended log ﬁle format, hence it is not possible for us to associate this data with any speciﬁc person.

        <p>3. Cookies</p>
        <p>In addition to the data listed above, cookies are downloaded and saved on your computer when you use our website. Cookies are small text ﬁles that are stored on the hard drive running the browser that you use to visit websites, and which send speciﬁc information to the entity that has set the cookie. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are used to help improve the online experience by making it more user-friendly and effective overall.<br /><br />
        Our website uses the following types of cookies and their scope and function is explained below:<br /><br />
        Transient cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser. These include session cookies in particular. These cookies download a so-called session ID onto your computer, which allows different requests by your browser to be assigned to the joint session. This makes it easier to recognise your computer when you return to our website. Session cookies are deleted when you log out, or when you close your browser. Persistent cookies are deleted automatically after a speciﬁed period that may differ from one cookie to the next. You can delete these cookies at any time via your browser's security settings. Third party cookies are saved on a user's computer by third party providers and not by Elysium and can be read on the Afﬁliate's computer when you next visit the website. Unlike the cookies used by Elysium itself, these are service providers that mainly collect information about users that is relevant for advertising and marketing purposes.<br /><br />
        You can conﬁgure your browser settings according to your personal preferences and refuse to accept third party cookies, or all cookies, for example. If you do not wish to allow ﬂash cookies, then you will need to install a corresponding add-on, e.g. "Better Privacy" for Mozilla Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/ﬁrefox/addon/betterprivacy/) or the Adobe Flash killer cookie for Google Chrome. You can prevent the use of HTML5 storage objects by selecting privacy mode or incognito mode in your browser. We also recommend that you clear your cookies and delete your browser history manually on a regular basis. We wish to point out that by deactivating cookies, you may not be able to use all functions of this website.<br /><br />
        The use of cookies is in the legitimate interests of Elysium for the purpose of improving our offer. The legal basis is Article 6 Para. 1 Page 1 Letter f GDPR.

            <p>We use "Facebook Pixel" on our website, which is a service of Facebook Inc., 1601 S California Ave, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA (hereinafter referred to as: "Facebook"). Facebook Pixel allows Facebook to display our advertisements on Facebook, so-called "Facebook Ads", only to those Facebook users who have visited our website, in particular, to those who have shown interest in our online offer or in speciﬁc topics or products. Facebook Pixel makes it possible to check whether a user was forwarded on to our website after clicking on our Facebook ads. Facebook Pixel uses cookies, which are small text ﬁles that are stored locally in the web browser's cache on your end device. If you have logged onto Facebook with your user account, the visit to our online range is stored in your user account. The data collected about you in this way remains anonymous for us, consequently this data cannot be used to draw any conclusions or make any associations regarding the identity of the user. However, Facebook can associate or link this data to your local user account. We have no inﬂuence on the scope or the further use of data that is collated by Facebook via the use of Facebook Pixel. To the best of our knowledge, Facebook receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding section or area of our website or clicked on one of our advertisements. If you have a Facebook user account and are registered, Facebook can associate the visit with your user account. Even if you have not created an account with Facebook or have not logged in, it is possible that Facebook will detect and store your IP address, and where applicable, other identifying features.<br /><br />
                We use Facebook Pixel for marketing and optimisation purposes, in particular to be able to bring you relevant and interesting advertisements on Facebook, thereby improving our products and services, making your user experience more memorable and preventing nuisance advertisements.<br /><br />
                You may object to the collection of your information by Facebook Pixel as described above and the use of your information to show you Facebook ads at any time. You can choose which types of advertisements you see on Facebook by changing your settings on the following Facebook web page: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads<br /><br />
                We wish to point out that this setting will be deactivated if you clear your cookies. You can also deactivate cookies that are used for reach metrics and advertising purposes via the following websites:<br /><br />

                We wish to point out that this setting will also be deactivated if you clear your cookies.<br /><br />
                In addition, Facebook complies with the Privacy Shield Framework agreement drawn up between the USA and the European Union and has obtained certiﬁcation. In doing so, Facebook undertakes to uphold the standards and requirements of European data protection law. Further information can be found on the web page linked below: https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active.<br /><br />

                <p>10. Use of Social Media Plug-Ins</p>
                <p>Elysium currently uses the following social media plug-ins (hereinafter referred to as: plug-ins): Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linked In, WhatsApp, Google+ and YouTube.<br /><br />
                To do so, the so-called two-click solution is employed. This means that when you visit the Elysium page, no personal information will initially be forwarded to the provider of the plug-ins. The plug-in provider can be identiﬁed by the marking in the checkbox above its initial letter or logo. Elysium offers you the option to communicate directly with the plug-in provider using the button. The provider of the plug-in will only receive the information that you have accessed on the corresponding Elysium page if you click on the selected area and it is then activated. The information listed in the "Access Data" section of this policy will also be transmitted. As the plug-in provider collects data mainly via cookies, Elysium recommends that you clear all cookies via your browser's security settings before clicking on the greyed-out box.<br /><br />
                Elysium has no inﬂuence on the data collected or the data processing methods, nor are we aware of the full extent of the data collection, the purposes of its processing or the data retention periods. We also have no information on the deletion of the data collected by the plug-in provider.<br /><br />
                The plug-in provider saves the information collected on the customer as usage proﬁles and uses these for the purposes of advertising, marketing, market research and/or for the demand-driven, customised design of its website. This kind of analysis is carried out in particular (also for users who are not logged in) to display demand-driven, customised advertising and to inform other users of the social network about the customer's activities on Elysium's website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user proﬁles. To exercise this right, you must contact the respective plug-in provider. Via plug-ins, Elysium offers you the possibility to interact with social networks as well as with other users, which helps us to improve and customise our offer and to make it more interesting for you as a customer.<br /><br />
                Data is forwarded regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in to this account. If you have logged in with the plug-in provider, the data that we have collected about you will be associated directly with your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you click on the activated button and link to the page, for example, the plug-in provider will also save this information in your user account and share it publicly with your contacts. After using a social network, Elysium recommends that you log out regularly, however, especially before clicking on the button, as this will prevent any association with your proﬁle with the plug-in provider.<br /><br />
                You will ﬁnd further information on the scope and purpose of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider in the shared data privacy policies of these providers listed below. Here you will also ﬁnd additional information on your rights and how to conﬁgure your settings in order to protect your privacy.<br /><br />
